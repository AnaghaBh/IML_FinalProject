# IML_FinalProject

# Through this project I want to look at how public opinion changes over time in response to a controversial advertisement or campaign. By using sentiment analysis on social media posts, news articles, and forum discussions, the aim is to track how initial reactions—whether positive or negative—evolve. Does an initial backlash turn into acceptance, or does it intensify? Additionally, also examine whether the phrase "all publicity is good publicity" holds true.
